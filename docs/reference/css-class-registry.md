# Style Rule Registry (formerly CSS Class Registry)

The site's style rule registry — `Record<string, StyleRule>` stored on the site shell (`site.styleRules`). Every user-defined CSS rule lives here. The publisher compiles entries to CSS at publish time; the editor's canvas injects the same CSS for live preview.

Two kinds of rules:

1. **Author-facing class rules** (`kind: 'class'`) — the user picks a name (`hero-button`, `card-meta`) and the editor applies them via `node.classIds`. Selector is `.<name>`.
2. **Ambient rules** (`kind: 'ambient'`) — attach by CSS selector matching, not by node assignment (e.g. `h1`, `.hero .title`, `a:hover`). The publisher emits the rule but never writes to `class=` attributes.
3. **Scoped classes** — generated class-kind rules owned by a single node (for "set this property only on this element"). The scope object pins the rule to its node.

---

## TL;DR

- Stored on `SiteShell.styleRules: Record<string, StyleRule>`.
- Source-of-truth schema: `StyleRuleSchema` in `src/core/page-tree/styleRule.ts`.
- Compiled to CSS by `classCss.ts` in the publisher; collected via `collectClassCSS(site)`.
- Each node references class-kind rules by id (`node.classIds: string[]`). Later ids in the array win in cascade order.
- Rule **name** is the display label; for class-kind rules the CSS selector is `.<name>`; for ambient rules the `selector` field is a verbatim CSS selector.
- Rule **id** is the stable internal identifier (`<nanoid>`).
- Scoped rules (`scope: { type: 'node', nodeId, role: 'module-style' }`) are pinned to one node.
- Generated rules (framework-emitted spacing utilities, etc.) are flagged on `generated` so the Properties panel selector picker can filter them out by default.

## The `StyleRule` shape

```ts
interface StyleRule {
  id:           string                              // nanoid, stable across renames
  name:         string                              // display name / CSS class name for class-kind rules
  kind:         'class' | 'ambient'                // discriminator
  selector:     string                              // CSS selector (e.g. '.hero-button' or 'h1 > span')
  order:        number                              // cascade order; rules sorted ascending by this
  description?: string
  scope?: {
    type:   'node'
    nodeId: string
    role:   'module-style'
  }
  styles:           Record<string, unknown>          // base CSS properties (CSSPropertyBag-shaped at write time)
  contextStyles:     Record<string, Record<string, unknown>>  // per-context overrides, keyed by context id
  generated?:    GeneratedClassMetadata               // framework-generated flags
  createdAt?:   number
  updatedAt?:   number
}
```

`contextStyles` is the **unified editing-context map** (see [docs/plans/2026-05-30-unified-condition-axis.md](../plans/2026-05-30-unified-condition-axis.md)). Each key is a *context id* that is **either**:

- a **width breakpoint id** (from `site.breakpoints`) → the publisher emits `@media (max-width: Npx)`; **or**
- a **custom condition id** (from `site.conditions`, the reusable `@media`/`@container`/`@supports` registry) → the publisher emits that condition's `@`-prelude.

This one map replaces the old split between `breakpointStyles` (width breakpoints) and `conditionalLayers` (everything else) — they were the same axis modelled twice. `parseStyleRule` migrates both legacy fields into `contextStyles`; the site-level `conditions` registry is reconstructed from legacy `conditionalLayers` in `parseSiteDocument`.

`styles` and `contextStyles` are typed `Record<string, unknown>` at the persistence boundary — narrowing happens at the publisher's `bagToCSS` (`classCss.ts`). The WRITE API (class slice, framework generators) uses the typed `CSSPropertyBag` shape from `src/core/page-tree/cssPropertyBag.ts`.

---

## Naming

Class-kind rule **name** is the public CSS identifier. It must be a valid CSS identifier. `assertValidCssClassName(name)` enforces:

- Starts with a letter or `-_`
- Contains only letters, digits, `-`, `_`
- Doesn't collide with reserved names

Rule **id** is internal (a nanoid). Refs from nodes (`classIds`) and from internal data structures use the id, not the name. This means renaming a rule doesn't break anything that references it.

Plugin-shipped rules are namespaced under the plugin id: `acme.template/hero-root`. See [docs/features/plugin-system.md](../features/plugin-system.md) (the pack section).

---

## Assigning class rules to nodes

```ts
interface PageNode {
  // ...
  classIds: string[]    // ordered; later ids win in CSS cascade
}
```

Only `kind: 'class'` rules are assigned via `classIds`. Ambient rules (`kind: 'ambient'`) attach by CSS matching and never appear in `classIds`.

The right Properties Panel exposes this through a unified selector picker:

- assigned class-kind rules appear as removable `TagPill` chips and add / remove entries from `node.classIds`;
- matching ambient rules appear as non-removable `TagPill` chips because they affect the selected element through CSS matching;
- non-matching ambient rules still appear in the dropdown, disabled with a "doesn't match this element" reason, so the user can see why the rule is not currently active.

The picker decides ambient matches against the selected live canvas element as the selector subject (`element.matches(selector)`). A selector such as `.hero .title` appears when the selected element is `.title`, not when the selected element is the `.hero` ancestor. Supported trailing pseudo-state selectors (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:focus-visible`, `:active`) are surfaced as inactive matches by stripping the trailing pseudo and testing the base selector.

Class order matters — drag-reorder is supported for assigned class pills.

At render time, `classNamesForClassIds(classIds, registry)` returns the rendered class names that go onto the element's `class=` attribute. `injectNodeClassIds(html, node, site)` in the publisher splices them into the root tag.

## Compiling rules to CSS

`collectClassCSS(site)` walks the style rule registry and emits CSS for each entry. Rules are sorted by `order` ascending so later, more-specific overrides appear later in source and win on equal specificity.

```text
For each rule in registry (sorted by order):
  selector = rule.selector               // e.g. '.hero-button' or 'h1 > span'
  base CSS  = bagToCSS(rule.styles)
  emit:     '${selector} { ${base CSS} }'

  for each (contextId, bag) in rule.contextStyles:
    if contextId is a custom condition (site.conditions):  // emitted first
      prelude = '@media <query>' | '@container [name] (<query>)' | '@supports (<query>)'
    else if contextId is a width breakpoint (site.breakpoints):  // emitted after, width-sorted
      prelude = '@media (max-width: ${width}px)'
    else:  // orphaned key — skipped
      continue
    emit: '${prelude} { ${selector} { ${bagToCSS(bag)} } }'
```

Cascade order within a rule: base → custom conditions (registry order) → width breakpoints (widest first, narrowest last).

The compiled string is part of the per-page CSS bundle (see [docs/features/publisher.md](../features/publisher.md) → CSS pipeline).

### `bagToCSS`

Translates the property bag (`{ color: '#fff', padding: { top: 16, right: 8 } }`) to CSS strings. Handles:

- Plain values: `color: #fff;`
- Spacing bags: `padding: 16px 8px 0 0;` (decomposed)
- Variable references: `color: var(--site-primary);`
- Multi-value props (transforms, transitions): joined per CSS rules

Invalid entries are silently dropped — the bag is tolerant.

---

## Scoped rules

A scoped rule is **owned by one node**. Its scope object pins it to that node's id and a role:

```ts
{
  id:    'class-abc',
  name:  '__pb_scope_<nodeId>',          // generated, never user-facing
  kind:  'class',
  selector: '.__pb_scope_<nodeId>',
  order: 0,
  scope: { type: 'node', nodeId: 'node-xyz', role: 'module-style' },
  styles: { 'border-radius': '12px' },
}
```

When the publisher emits the selector, it generates a uniquely-prefixed name so it can't be applied accidentally elsewhere:

```css
[data-node-id="node-xyz"].__pb_scope_node-xyz {
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

Use scoped rules when you want **per-node styling** without polluting the global class palette. The Properties Panel exposes this via "Edit only this element" controls.

### Duplicating nodes with scoped rules

When a node is duplicated, its scoped rules need fresh ids that point at the duplicated nodes (not the originals). `cloneScopedClassesForNodeMap(scopedRules, oldToNewIdMap)` rewrites them in one pass.

Called by `duplicateNode` and `pasteSubtree` in `src/core/page-tree/mutations.ts`.

---

## Generated rules (framework + plugin)

A "generated" rule is one the codebase emits programmatically — typically the spacing scale utilities (`.pad-1`, `.pad-2`, ...) or the typography scale. They have `generated.origin === 'framework'` with family/step tags.

`classUtils.ts`:

```ts
isUserVisibleClass(cls)        // false for generated rules — hides them from the selector picker by default
isGeneratedClass(cls)          // true if `generated.origin === 'framework'`
isGeneratedClassLocked(cls)    // true if the rule is locked from manual edit (the framework owns its styles)
generatedClassKindLabel(cls)   // e.g. 'Spacing', 'Typography' — for grouping in selector-picker rows
```

The framework regenerates these rules whenever the user changes the framework scale (Site → Framework → Scale panel). Users can opt to show them in the selector picker via Settings → Editor → Show framework-generated classes.

## Tolerant parse

`parseStyleRule(raw)` is tolerant — it never throws. Invalid `scope` shapes drop silently; missing `styles` falls back to `{}`; missing `id` or `name` makes the whole entry skip. `parseStyleRuleRegistry(raw)` walks an entire registry and filters out invalid entries.

This is what makes the editor robust against partially-corrupt persisted data — a single broken rule doesn't break the whole site load.

The tolerant parser also backfills `kind`, `selector`, and `order` on old persisted shells that predate the selectors system.

Hard parsing (throws on shape mismatch) uses `Value.Parse(StyleRuleSchema, raw)` directly. The persistence layer uses the tolerant path so the editor can render even with garbage entries.

## Cookbook

### Create a class-kind rule

```ts
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid'
import type { StyleRule } from '@core/page-tree'
import { classKindSelector } from '@core/page-tree'

const name = 'hero-button'
const rule: StyleRule = {
  id:       nanoid(),
  name,
  kind:     'class',
  selector: classKindSelector(name),
  order:    0,
  styles: {
    'background-color': 'var(--site-primary)',
    'padding':          { top: 12, right: 24, bottom: 12, left: 24 },
    'border-radius':    '8px',
  },
}

useEditorStore.getState().createClass(rule)
```

The rule is added to `site.styleRules`. The publisher emits CSS for it on next publish.

### Assign a class rule to a node

```ts
useEditorStore.getState().setNodeClassIds(nodeId, ['hero-button'])
```

The class names appear on the rendered element via `classNamesForClassIds`.

### Per-context styles (breakpoints + custom conditions)

```ts
{
  id:    'card',
  name:  'card',
  kind:  'class',
  selector: '.card',
  order: 0,
  styles:        { padding: 16, 'border-radius': 8 },
  contextStyles: {
    mobile:  { padding: 8 },                       // width breakpoint id
    desktop: { padding: 24 },                      // width breakpoint id
    'media:(orientation: landscape)': { padding: 12 },  // custom condition id (site.conditions)
  },
}
```

The publisher wraps each context block in the matching `@media (max-width: …)` (width breakpoint) or the custom condition's `@media`/`@container`/`@supports` prelude.

### Scoped rule for one node

The Properties Panel's "Custom" tab generates a scoped rule automatically when the user sets a property only on that node. Internally:

```ts
const name = `__pb_scope_${nodeId}`
const scoped: StyleRule = {
  id:       nanoid(),
  name,
  kind:     'class',
  selector: classKindSelector(name),
  order:    0,
  scope: { type: 'node', nodeId, role: 'module-style' },
  styles: { 'border-radius': '12px' },
}
useEditorStore.getState().createClass(scoped)
useEditorStore.getState().setNodeClassIds(nodeId, [...existing, scoped.id])
```

The user never sees `__pb_scope_<nodeId>` — the panel shows it as "Custom styles".

### Rename a class rule

Rule **id** is stable; **name** is editable. The editor mutates `rule.name`. Nodes that reference the rule by id keep working — only the rendered CSS class name changes.

### Delete a rule

`useEditorStore.getState().deleteClass(classId)`:

1. Remove the entry from `site.styleRules`.
2. Walk every node and remove the id from `classIds`.
3. (Optional) If the rule is scoped to a now-deleted node, the rule can be GC'd alongside.
