# Instatic Docs

The documentation tree for Instatic. This index tells you what to read, in what order, and where to look for what.

If you're an agent: start at `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) for the rules, then come here for the explanations.
If you're a human contributor: start with [`architecture.md`](architecture.md), then read whichever feature or reference page is closest to what you're changing.

```

Three categories, three voices:

- **Top-level docs** are long-lived references that describe the system as it currently is.
- **Feature docs** describe one first-class capability — its architecture, lifecycle, file layout.
- **Reference docs** are short, focused cookbooks for primitives and patterns reused across features.

Plans (`docs/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/`) describe in-flight work. Plans are deleted or converted to feature/reference docs when the work ships.

## Where to look first

### "I want to understand the system"

1. [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — the 10-minute orientation. Process layout, layer responsibilities, request lifecycle, publishing pipeline, plugin sandbox, where everything lives.
2. [`design.md`](design.md) — what the editor looks like and why. Tokens, surface system, UI primitives.
3. [`server.md`](server.md) and [`editor.md`](editor.md) — the two deep dives. Pick whichever side you're touching.

### "I want to add a feature"

1. Skim [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) → "Where things live — decision table".
2. Read the feature doc closest to what you're adding (e.g. [`features/plugin-system.md`](features/plugin-system.md) for a plugin SDK extension).
3. Read the relevant reference doc(s) for the primitives you'll touch ([`reference/page-tree.md`](reference/page-tree.md), [`reference/database-dialects.md`](reference/database-dialects.md), [`reference/typebox-patterns.md`](reference/typebox-patterns.md)).
4. Make the change. Verify with `bun test && bun run build && bun run lint`.

### "I want to change the visual design"

1. [`design.md`](design.md) — the principles, tokens, surface systems.
2. `src/styles/globals.css` — the actual tokens.
3. `src/ui/components/` — the actual primitives.
4. If you're adding a new token or surface pattern, update `design.md` in the same change.

### "I want to add a new HTTP endpoint"

1. [`server.md`](server.md) → "Adding a new endpoint".
2. [`reference/typebox-patterns.md`](reference/typebox-patterns.md) for body validation.
3. [`reference/database-dialects.md`](reference/database-dialects.md) if persistence is involved.

### "I want to mutate the page tree"

1. [`reference/page-tree.md`](reference/page-tree.md) — the `NodeTree` primitive and `mutateActiveTree`.
2. [`editor.md`](editor.md) → "Editor store" for how mutations are wired up.

### "I want to write a plugin"

1. [`features/plugin-system.md`](features/plugin-system.md) — the SDK surface, lifecycle, sandbox rules.
2. `examples/plugins/template/` — working example.
3. `src/core/plugin-sdk/capabilities.ts` — permission catalog (source of truth).

### "I want to deploy / operate the CMS"

1. `README.md` (repo root) — install, run, basic commands.
2. [`deployment/README.md`](deployment/README.md) — platform and generic deployment targets.
3. [`deployment/backup-restore.md`](deployment/backup-restore.md) — backing up production data.

## Conventions in one paragraph

Every doc has the shape: **one-line scope statement → TL;DR → body sections → Related**. Every claim about code anchors to a real file path. Every invariant links to the gate test (in `src/__tests__/architecture/`) that enforces it. No history, no aspiration, no marketing copy — describe what the system is, not what it could be or what it used to be. If a doc is over ~600 lines, it's doing too much; split it. The full rules are in [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md).
