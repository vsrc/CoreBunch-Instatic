# Architecture

System-level overview of Page Builder CMS — what runs, what depends on what, and where to look first.

Page Builder is a self-hosted CMS with a built-in visual page builder. One Bun process serves the public website, the admin editor, the CMS API, published pages, and uploaded media, backed by either Postgres or SQLite. The visual editor's output is plain semantic HTML and hand-clean CSS — no framework runtime is injected into published pages.

---

## TL;DR

- **One process, two off-main-thread workers**: `bun server/index.ts`. `Bun.serve` + a hand-written router (`server/router.ts`) routes every request. Plugin server code runs in per-plugin `Bun.Worker`s wrapping a QuickJS-WASM sandbox; image-variant generation (`sharp` + BlurHash) runs in a separate `Bun.Worker` pool. Everything else — HTTP, the admin API, the streaming agent endpoint, the publisher — runs on the main thread.
- **One database, two engines**: Postgres (via `Bun.sql`) or SQLite (`bun:sqlite`), selected by `DATABASE_URL`. Repositories are dialect-naive; migrations are split per dialect with identical IDs.
- **One content model**: posts, pages, and visual components all live in `data_tables` + `data_rows`. No separate `pages` table. Page trees and VC trees both use the `NodeTree<TNode>` primitive.
- **Two frontends, one bundle**: the admin app (`src/admin/`) shells the visual editor (`src/admin/pages/site/`). Both run in the same Vite-built SPA, mounted under `/admin/*`.
- **Plugins run sandboxed**: server entrypoints and canvas module packs execute inside a QuickJS-WASM VM with no host access. They reach the CMS through the SDK at `src/core/plugin-sdk/`.
- **One public-route surface**: every visitor request for HTML — stand-alone pages and content rows alike — flows through `server/publish/publicRouter.ts`. The publish step writes a `PublishedPageSnapshot` (JSON) to `data_row_versions.snapshot_json`; the renderer (`publishPage` in `src/core/publisher/`) materialises HTML from that snapshot on each request. Output is plain semantic HTML + a single CSS bundle per page, no client-side hydration of layout. (Static-to-disk caching is a future change; the seam to add it is `publicRouter.ts`.)
- **Multi-instance HA on Postgres**: both schedulers (plugin tick + scheduled publish) use `pg_try_advisory_lock` for leader election, so running multiple containers behind a load balancer doesn't double-fire scheduled work. SQLite is single-instance by definition.
- **Every untyped boundary uses TypeBox.** HTTP responses, request bodies, persisted JSON, plugin manifests, settings. `zod` is banned outside `server/handlers/agent/tools.ts`.

```

The same process serves visitors, admins, the API, the streaming agent endpoint, and uploads. Two kinds of work that would otherwise block the main thread are pushed into `Bun.Worker`s:

- **Plugin server entrypoints + canvas module packs** run inside a per-plugin `Bun.Worker` that hosts a QuickJS-WASM sandbox. The host process never imports plugin code. A crash in one plugin worker only affects that plugin; the host respawns it with a crash budget (`server/plugins/host/crashRecovery.ts`).
- **Image-variant generation** (`sharp` resize + WebP encode + BlurHash) runs in a small pool of `Bun.Worker`s. A 4 MP JPEG is ~200–500 ms of CPU per upload; offloading it keeps visitor requests and the admin API responsive when an admin (or a future first-party feature) uploads images in bulk.

There is no message queue, no managed service surface. Scaling out is a horizontal-Postgres play: both schedulers (plugin tick + scheduled-publish tick) use `pg_try_advisory_lock` for leader election so multiple instances behind a load balancer don't double-fire scheduled work. SQLite mode is single-instance by definition; the lock dance is a no-op there.

## Request lifecycle

```text
HTTP request
    │
    ▼
server/index.ts          ← Bun.serve fetch handler
    │
    ▼
server/router.ts         ← match path
    │
    ├─→ /admin/api/cms/*    → server/handlers/cms/<resource>.ts
    │       │
    │       ├─→ server/auth         (session + capability checks)
    │       ├─→ server/repositories (DB access)
    │       └─→ server/db/client    (Postgres or SQLite)
    │
    ├─→ /admin/api/cms/plugins/<id>/runtime/* → plugin worker (QuickJS)
    │
    ├─→ /admin/*            → static SPA (dist/index.html)
    │
    ├─→ /uploads/*          → server/static.ts (file disk)
    │
    └─→ /*  (everything else) → server/publish/publicRouter.ts
                                  → page snapshot OR data row + template
                                  → publishPage() (live render) → HTML
                                  → applyPublishedHtmlPipeline (plugin
                                    injection + publish.html filter)
                                  → 301 redirect / 200 HTML / 404
```

Handlers validate request bodies with TypeBox before doing work, talk to repositories for persistence, and return `{ error: string }` envelopes on failure. Validation helpers live in `server/http.ts`. Per-handler logging uses the prefix `console.error('[<module>]', err)`.

## Data model

Everything content-shaped lives in two tables.

### `data_tables` (system table)

A user-defined collection — a "post type" in WordPress terms. Has a `kind`:

| `kind`       | Used for                                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `postType`   | Blog posts, products, anything list-like      |
| `page`       | Stand-alone pages with URLs                   |
| `component`  | Visual components (reusable subtrees)         |

The three system tables (`posts`, `pages`, `components`) are seeded by the baseline migration and are locked from rename/delete.

### `data_rows`

Rows in a `data_tables` collection. Stored cells are typed — a row in the `pages` table has a `body` cell of type `pageTree`; a row in `components` has a `tree` cell of type `pageTree` plus a `params` cell of type `fieldSchema`.

The shape and cell types are defined by the `data_tables` schema. There is no separate `pages` table, no `page_versions` table, no per-feature row layout. Adding a new "post type" means inserting a `data_tables` row with the right `cells` schema.

### Storage conventions

- JSON columns end in `_json`. The SQLite adapter auto-parses any `*_json` string on read and auto-stringifies any plain object on write. Gated by `db-json-column-naming.test.ts`.
- Migrations are split per dialect with identical IDs. PG uses `jsonb`, `timestamptz`, `bigint`, `distinct on`; SQLite uses `text`, `text`, `integer`, window-function rewrites. Parity gated by `migration-parity.test.ts`.
- Repositories use only ANSI-standard SQL. The five Postgres-isms — `now()` in DML, `::int`, `::jsonb`, `any($N::...)`, `distinct on` — are banned in any `DbClient`-importing file. Gated by `db-postgres-isms.test.ts`.

See [docs/reference/database-dialects.md](reference/database-dialects.md) for the full rules.

---

## The page tree primitive

Every tree-of-nodes in the CMS — page trees, Visual Component trees, slot fills — has one shape:

```ts
type NodeTree<TNode> = {
  nodes: Record<string, TNode>
  rootNodeId: string
}
```

Defined in `src/core/page-tree/treeSchema.ts` (single source of truth). Mutations operate on any `NodeTree` generically via `src/core/page-tree/mutations.ts`.

Routing to the active tree (page vs. VC mode) is the **sole** job of `mutateActiveTree(fn)` in `src/admin/pages/site/store/siteSlice.ts`. The 11 named tree-mutation store actions (`insertNode`, `deleteNode`, `updateNodeProps`, `setBreakpointOverride`, `clearBreakpointOverride`, `renameNode`, `toggleNodeLocked`, `toggleNodeHidden`, `moveNode`, `duplicateNode`, `wrapNode`) are one-liners that call `mutateActiveTree`. They must not contain their own `kind === 'visualComponent'` routing branch — gated by `no-vc-mode-branches-in-mutations.test.ts`.

See [docs/reference/page-tree.md](reference/page-tree.md) for the type shape and mutation cookbook.

## Publishing pipeline

```text
Editor state (Zustand store)
    │
    │  user clicks Publish (or `publishDataRow` for posts/etc.)
    ▼
publishDraftSite / publishDataRow      ← server/repositories/publish.ts
    │
    │  freezes the page tree + site shell into a `PublishedPageSnapshot`,
    │  writes it to `data_row_versions.snapshot_json`, flips the row's
    │  `status` to 'published'
    ▼
data_row_versions.snapshot_json        ← canonical published artefact (JSON)
    │
    ▼
visitor request → server/publish/publicRouter.ts
    │
    ▼
publishPage (src/core/publisher/)      ← renderer
    │
    │  walks the page tree from the snapshot, resolves modules, expands
    │  VCs and slots, emits clean HTML + a single CSS bundle per page
    ▼
applyPublishedHtmlPipeline             ← plugin frontend-asset injection +
                                         publish.before / publish.html /
                                         publish.after hook side-effects
    ▼
HTTP response (HTML 200 / 301 / 404)
```

Key properties:

- **One published-route surface.** `server/publish/publicRouter.ts` is the single resolver + renderer for every visitor URL. Stand-alone pages (`/about`) and content rows rendered through a postType's entry template (`/posts/hello`) both flow through it. The earlier split between `tryServePublishedPage` and `tryServeContentRoute` collapsed into one path after the pages → `data_rows` migration finished — pages, posts, and components are all `data_rows` now, the only branch is "page (renders its own body) vs. row (renders through a matching entry template)".
- **Live render, snapshot-backed.** A publish writes a `PublishedPageSnapshot` (JSON) to `data_row_versions.snapshot_json` and flips the row's status to `'published'`. Visitor requests re-run `publishPage()` against that snapshot. The renderer is deterministic and cheap (kB-scale CSS, no client-side hydration of layout); a future change can layer in static-to-disk or in-memory caching keyed by `(url, snapshotVersion)` without touching the rest of the pipeline. There is no `uploads/published/<route>.html` step today.
- **Pure render, no client-side hydration of layout.** Published pages are HTML and CSS. Plugins can inject frontend assets (`server/publish/frontendInjections.ts`), but the page structure is static.
- **Sanitization happens at the publisher boundary.** DOMPurify in `src/core/sanitize.ts` cleans rich-text and HTML strings before they're frozen into a snapshot.
- **Visual components are inlined.** Each VC instance is expanded with its slot fills materialized as locked child nodes in the consumer page tree. The publisher pairs each `base.slot-instance` with the matching `base.slot-outlet` by `slotName`.

---

## Plugin system

Plugins are zip packages containing a `plugin.json` manifest and bundled entrypoints. The host runs plugin code in a **QuickJS-WASM sandbox**:

- `entrypoints.server` runs in `server/plugins/quickjsHost.ts`
- `entrypoints.modules` (canvas module packs) run in `server/plugins/modulePackVm.ts`
- Author-facing API lives in `src/core/plugin-sdk/`
- Host-side runtime (install, activate, deactivate, uninstall) lives in `src/core/plugins/`

The sandbox has no Node, no Bun, no file system, no environment variables, and no network unless the plugin declares `network.outbound` permission and a `networkAllowedHosts` allowlist. The `pb-plugin build` CLI emits IIFE bundles and scans for forbidden literals (`'node:'`, `'bun:'`, `require(`, `process.binding`); the install handler scans again as defense-in-depth.

Sandbox invariants are gated by `src/__tests__/architecture/plugin-sandbox-invariants.test.ts`.

See [docs/features/plugin-system.md](features/plugin-system.md) for the full feature doc.

## Frontend architecture

### Two apps, one bundle

The browser bundle is a single Vite-built React 19 SPA, mounted at `/admin`. Inside it:

- `src/admin/` — the **admin shell**: routing, sessions, top-level navigation, the workspaces for content / media / plugins / users / dashboard, and the plugin host UI.
- `src/admin/pages/site/` — the **visual editor**: the canvas, panels, toolbar, picker, property controls, and the editor store (Zustand + Immer). This is the page builder itself.

The split exists because the editor is a self-contained app with its own state and lifecycle, but it shares the admin's auth, routing, and theming.

### Routing

In-house router at `src/admin/lib/router.tsx` and `src/admin/lib/routerHooks.ts`. Replaces `react-router-dom` for the 4-route admin app. **Admin-only** — banned in `src/admin/pages/site/`, `src/core/`, and `src/modules/`, gated by `no-router-in-site-page.test.ts`.

### State

- Admin shell: small contexts in `src/admin/state/` and `src/admin/sessionContext.ts`.
- Editor: Zustand store at `src/admin/pages/site/store/`, mutating page tree state via Immer. The store routes mutations to the active tree (page or VC) through `mutateActiveTree(fn)`.

### Styling

- CSS Modules only in `src/admin/` and `src/admin/pages/site/`. No Tailwind utility classes — gated by `noTailwindUtilities.test.ts`.
- All colors and radii come from CSS custom properties in `src/styles/globals.css`. No hardcoded hex / rgb / hsl. See [docs/design.md](design.md).
- Class composition uses the in-house `cn` helper at `src/ui/cn.ts`. No `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, or `@radix-ui/*`. Gated by `no-tailwind-deps.test.ts`.

See [docs/editor.md](editor.md) for the visual editor deep-dive.

## Validation at every boundary

The codebase enforces "validate, then trust": every untyped input goes through a [TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) schema. Inside the boundary, code trusts the parsed value.

| Boundary                             | Helper                                                | Lives in                              |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| HTTP response (client)               | `parseJsonResponse(res, Schema)`                      | `src/core/utils/jsonValidate.ts`      |
| Persistence layer envelope (client)  | `readEnvelope(res, Schema, fallbackMessage)`          | `src/core/persistence/httpJson.ts`    |
| `JSON.parse` of persisted strings    | `safeParseJson(raw, Schema)` / `parseJsonWithFallback`| `src/core/utils/jsonValidate.ts`      |
| Request body (server)                | TypeBox schema in handler                             | `server/http.ts` helpers              |
| Plugin manifest                      | `parsePluginManifest`                                 | `src/core/plugins/manifest.ts`        |
| Site document on load                | `validateSite`                                        | `src/core/persistence/validate.ts`    |

Domain types come from `Static<typeof Schema>`. There is no parallel `interface Foo` next to `FooSchema`. **Schemas are the source of truth.**

`zod` is banned from app and core code. The only legitimate `zod` usage is `server/handlers/agent/tools.ts`, because `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s `tool()` API has a type-level `AnyZodRawShape` constraint TypeBox can't satisfy. Gated by `no-anthropic-sdk.test.ts` and import scans.

See [docs/reference/typebox-patterns.md](reference/typebox-patterns.md) for the cookbook.

## Where things live — decision table

When making a change, this table answers "where does it go?"

| You're adding…                                         | Put it in                                                  |

## Invariants enforced by tests

Architectural rules live as tests in `src/__tests__/architecture/*.test.ts` and run as part of `bun test`. Changing a structural rule means updating the matching test. The most load-bearing gates:

| Rule                                                                                                  | Gate                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Migrations parity between PG and SQLite                                                               | `migration-parity.test.ts`                                      |
| JSON columns end in `_json`                                                                           | `db-json-column-naming.test.ts`                                 |
| No Postgres-isms in repositories                                                                      | `db-postgres-isms.test.ts`                                      |
| Page tree uses `NodeTree<PageNode>` only                                                              | `task455-tree-primitive.test.ts`                                |
| Store mutations don't branch on VC mode                                                               | `no-vc-mode-branches-in-mutations.test.ts`                      |
| No Tailwind utility classes (covers all palette names: `bg-zinc-*`, `text-blue-*`, etc.)              | `noTailwindUtilities.test.ts`, `no-tailwind-deps.test.ts`       |
| Every color in admin / ui CSS modules comes from a token (no hardcoded hex / rgb / hsl)               | `css-token-policy.test.ts`                                      |
| No `react-router-dom` in the editor                                                                   | `no-router-in-site-page.test.ts`                                |
| All buttons go through the `Button` primitive                                                         | `button-primitive-usage.test.ts`                                |
| Icons come from `pixel-art-icons`                                                                     | `no-third-party-icons.test.ts`, `direct-icon-imports.test.ts`   |
| Vendored icon set is fresh                                                                            | `vendor-icons-fresh.test.ts`                                    |
| Plugin sandbox invariants (no `node:`, `bun:`, `require`, etc.)                                       | `plugin-sandbox-invariants.test.ts`                             |
| No `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (must use `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`)                                    | `no-anthropic-sdk.test.ts`                                      |
| UI primitives live in `src/ui/components/`                                                            | `ui-primitives-location.test.ts`                                |

## Build, run, test

```sh
# install
bun install

# develop
bun run dev              # SQLite at .tmp/dev.db, no Docker
DATABASE_URL=postgres://… bun run dev   # Postgres mode

# verify
bun run build            # tsc -b && vite build (typecheck + bundle)
bun test                 # unit + architecture tests
bun run lint             # eslint with cache
```

`bun run build` runs both `tsc -b` and `vite build` — a change that runs in dev but fails `tsc` is not done. Verification is an end-of-task gate, not a per-edit ritual; see `CLAUDE.md` for the rules around pre-existing failures from parallel sessions.
