# Deployment

This index maps supported deployment targets to the files, variables, and persistence rules they need.

Instatic is one Bun server packaged by the root `Dockerfile`. The server reads runtime configuration from `server/config.ts`: `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `UPLOADS_DIR`, and `STATIC_DIR`. AI provider credentials are encrypted with `INSTATIC_SECRET_KEY` when configured. Database migrations run automatically on boot in `server/index.ts`.

## TL;DR

| Target | Use when | Database | Persistent storage | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Railway SQLite template | Fastest managed install for a single site | SQLite file | One Railway app volume mounted at `/app/storage` | [railway.md](railway.md) |
| Railway Postgres template | Managed install for teams or horizontal scale later | Railway Postgres | App volume for uploads, Postgres service volume for DB | [railway.md](railway.md) |
| VPS Docker Compose | Self-hosted server, full control | SQLite or bundled Postgres | Docker named volumes | [vps.md](vps.md) |
| Generic Docker host | Any platform that runs the Dockerfile/image | SQLite or external Postgres | A mounted directory/volume for DB/uploads | [docker-image.md](docker-image.md) |
| VPS HTTPS | Public domain on a VPS | Unchanged | Caddy cert volume plus app volumes | [tls-caddy.md](tls-caddy.md) |

Back up both the database and uploaded media. See [backup-restore.md](backup-restore.md).

## Runtime Contract

Every deployment target configures the same process:

```txt
PORT          HTTP port the Bun server listens on
DATABASE_URL  sqlite:/path/to/cms.db, file:/path/to/cms.db, postgres://..., or postgresql://...
UPLOADS_DIR   directory for media, plugin packs, fonts, and published disk artefacts
STATIC_DIR    built admin SPA directory; /app/dist in the Docker image
INSTATIC_SECRET_KEY  base64 32-byte key for encrypted AI provider credentials
```

Generate `INSTATIC_SECRET_KEY` with `bun run scripts/generate-secret-key.ts` before adding Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter credentials in production. Without it, the admin can load but saving AI credentials fails because there is no stable encryption key.

The Docker image sets:

```txt
PORT=3001
STATIC_DIR=/app/dist
UPLOADS_DIR=/app/uploads
```

Managed platforms often override `PORT`. That is fine; the server uses `process.env.PORT`.

## Image Availability

Release bundles plus the published GHCR image are the default portable install path:

```sh
INSTATIC_IMAGE=ghcr.io/corebunch/instatic:latest docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml up -d
```

Pin a semver tag for predictable upgrades:

```sh
INSTATIC_IMAGE=ghcr.io/corebunch/instatic:0.0.1 docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml up -d
```

Source builds remain supported for contributors and release-candidate testing:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml -f compose.build.yml up -d --build
```

The maintainer release target is `ghcr.io/corebunch/instatic`, documented in [release-workflow.md](release-workflow.md).

## Database Choice

The database engine is selected only by `DATABASE_URL`:

| URL shape | Engine |
|---|---|
| `sqlite:/path/to/cms.db` | SQLite |
| `file:/path/to/cms.db` | SQLite |
| `/path/to/cms.db` | SQLite |
| `postgres://...` | Postgres |
| `postgresql://...` | Postgres |

SQLite is the default for single-site installs. Postgres is for multiple simultaneous admin writers, more than one app container, or operators who already want managed Postgres.

## Persistence Rules

`UPLOADS_DIR` is required for durable media regardless of the database engine. It stores:

- uploaded media originals and variants
- uploaded fonts
- plugin packages and module packs
- published static artefacts under `published/current`

SQLite installs also need the SQLite database file on persistent storage. On platforms with only one app volume, put both the SQLite file and uploads under the same mounted root.

| [vps.md](vps.md) | Docker Compose on a VPS, both SQLite and Postgres |
| [docker-image.md](docker-image.md) | Generic Docker image contract and `docker run` examples |
| [tls-caddy.md](tls-caddy.md) | Caddy TLS overlay for VPS Compose installs |
| [backup-restore.md](backup-restore.md) | Database and uploads backup/restore |
| [release-workflow.md](release-workflow.md) | Maintainer image publishing workflow |
