# Visual Components

Visual Components (VCs) — reusable subtrees with named parameters and named slots. A VC is authored once, instantiated on pages via a `base.visual-component-ref` node, and inlined by the publisher at render time.

A VC **is** a `NodeTree<VCNode>` (structurally identical to `NodeTree<BaseNode>`) plus a list of parameters. A VC consumed on a page is a `base.visual-component-ref` node whose children include one `base.slot-instance` per slot the VC declares. Slot content lives in the consumer page tree as ordinary nodes, not as a separate prop.

---

## TL;DR

- VCs are stored as rows in the `components` system table (`data_tables.kind = 'component'`).
- Type lives in `src/core/visualComponents/schemas.ts`. **`VCNode === BaseNode`** — no `dynamicBindings` (that's page-tree only).
- Parameters: typed (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `url`, `enum`, `color`, `image`, `richText`, `slot`) with `defaultValue`, `required`, optional `enumOptions` and `description`.
- **Slots are `base.slot-outlet` nodes inside the VC tree.** The outlet IS the slot — no separate `vc.params` slot entry. Multiple outlets with the same `slotName` count as one slot.
- A consumer's `base.visual-component-ref` has one `base.slot-instance` child per declared slot, in param order, kept in sync by `syncSlotInstances(...)` (`slotSync.ts`).
- Cycles (VC A references VC B which references A) are blocked by `wouldCreateCycle(...)` before mutations apply.
- The publisher's `renderVisualComponentRef` (`src/core/publisher/renderVisualComponentRef.ts`) inlines the VC tree with prop-binding substitution.

## Data model

### `VisualComponent` (the source-of-truth schema)

`src/core/visualComponents/schemas.ts`:

```ts
export const VisualComponentSchema = Type.Object({
  id:          Type.String(),
  name:        Type.String(),
  description: Type.Optional(Type.String()),
  tree:        NodeTreeSchema,      // NodeTree<VCNode>
  params:      Type.Array(VCParamSchema),
  // ... metadata fields
})
export type VisualComponent = Static<typeof VisualComponentSchema>
```

Stored in `data_rows` (`table_id = 'components'`), serialized via `componentFromRow.ts` / `componentToRow.ts` in `src/core/data/`.

### `VCParam`

```ts
{
  id:           string         // nanoid; survives renames
  name:         string         // free-form, unique within the VC
  type:         VCParamType    // 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'url' | 'enum' | 'color' | 'image' | 'richText' | 'slot'
  description?: string
  defaultValue: unknown
  required:     boolean
  enumOptions?: string[]       // only meaningful when type === 'enum'
}
```

- The **`id` is stable** across renames; refs and bindings point at the `id`, not the `name`.
- Param **names** are validated at the slice boundary by `validateParamName` (`nameValidation.ts`).
- Param **types** include `'slot'` — but slot params are derived from `base.slot-outlet` nodes in the tree, not authored separately.

### `VCNode` (`= BaseNode`)

A VC tree node is structurally identical to a `BaseNode`. The only difference from `PageNode`: no `dynamicBindings` field (template data-binding is page-tree-only).

VC tree shape: `NodeTree<VCNode> = { nodes: Record<string, VCNode>, rootNodeId: string }` — same as any other tree.

---

## Slots

The slot model is **the slot-outlet IS the slot**. There is no separate `params: [{ type: 'slot', name: 'header' }]` declaration. A VC author drops a `base.slot-outlet` node anywhere in the VC tree, sets its `slotName` prop, and that's the entire authoring step.

```text
VC definition tree:
  base.body
    base.container
      base.heading              "Header"
      base.slot-outlet          (slotName: 'header')
    base.container
      base.slot-outlet          (slotName: 'body')
    base.slot-outlet            (slotName: 'footer')

  → declares three slots: 'header', 'body', 'footer'
```

Multiple `base.slot-outlet` nodes with the same `slotName` render the same slot's content at multiple positions, but count as **one** slot for the consumer's `base.slot-instance`.

### Slot extraction order

`syncSlotInstances` walks the VC's tree in DFS pre-order. The first appearance of a `slotName` wins for ordering. The default `slotName` is `'children'` when the outlet's `props.slotName` is missing or empty.

### `base.slot-instance` on the consumer side

When a `base.visual-component-ref` is dropped onto a page, `syncSlotInstances` ensures the ref has exactly one `base.slot-instance` child per slot the VC declares, in param order. Each slot-instance carries:

- `slotName` prop — matches the outlet's `slotName`
- `locked: true` — the editor prevents moving / deleting it (only the user content **inside** is editable)
- Children — the user's content for that slot

```text
Consumer page tree:
  base.body
    base.container
      base.visual-component-ref     (refers to VC 'CardLayout')
        base.slot-instance          (slotName: 'header', locked)
          base.text "Welcome"
        base.slot-instance          (slotName: 'body', locked)
          base.image
          base.text
        base.slot-instance          (slotName: 'footer', locked)
          base.button "Sign up"
```

No `slotContent` prop. No separate tree. All slot fills are ordinary materialized children in the consumer page tree.

---

## `syncSlotInstances`

`src/core/visualComponents/slotSync.ts` — pure function that computes the ops needed to bring a VC ref's children into alignment with its referenced VC's slots.

```ts
syncSlotInstances(refNode, vc, allNodes) → SyncResult
applySlotSyncResult(nodesMap, result)
```

Three op kinds:

| Op            | When it fires                                                            |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `InsertSlot`  | The VC declares a slot the ref doesn't have a slot-instance for yet      |
| `RenameSlot`  | The slot's `name` changed in the VC; the existing slot-instance's `slotName` prop updates |
| `DeleteSlot`  | The VC removed a slot; the matching slot-instance + its subtree are dropped |

Slot-instances are matched to slots by **slot id, not name**, so renaming a slot in the VC carries the user's content with it.

`applySlotSyncResult` is called inside Immer producers in `siteSlice` and `visualComponentsSlice` so the mutation participates in the editor's undo history.

When the ref is first inserted, slot-instances are seeded with the slot's default content from the VC's `slot-outlet.children` (if any). After that, edits inside slot-instances are owned by the consumer page.

---

## Param substitution and prop bindings

A VC ref instance carries `instanceProps` — the values for the VC's `params`. Inside the VC tree, any node prop can be bound to a param via `propBindings`:

```jsonc
// A node inside the VC tree:
{
  "id": "...",
  "moduleId": "base.heading",
  "props": { "text": "Default", "level": 2 },
  "propBindings": {
    "text": { "paramId": "<heading-param-id>" }
  }
}
```

At render time, `renderVisualComponentRef`:

1. Iterates the ref's `instanceProps` keyed by `paramId`.
2. For each VC node with `propBindings`, replaces the bound prop value with the matching `instanceProps[paramId]` (or the param's `defaultValue` if unset).
3. The substituted props pass through `escapeProps` like any other node.

So inside the VC, props always have a "design-time default" (in `node.props`); at render time, the binding overrides it with the instance value.

### Inserting a binding

The editor's Properties Panel shows a "bind to param" affordance for each prop on a VC tree node. Selecting a param adds `propBindings[propKey] = { paramId }` and the canvas re-renders the VC with the bound value.

---

## Recursion guard

A VC must not reference itself (directly or via a chain). `src/core/visualComponents/recursionGuard.ts`:

```ts
wouldCreateCycle(vcId, targetVcId, allVCs) → boolean
```

The mutation paths that insert a `base.visual-component-ref` call `wouldCreateCycle` first; if true, the mutation aborts and the UI shows a `VisualComponentRecursionError`.

`getReferencedComponentIds(vc)` returns the direct refs from a VC's tree; the cycle check walks the graph transitively.

---

## Instantiation flow

```text
User drops a VC ref onto the canvas
    │
    ▼
mutateActiveTree((tree) => {
    ├─→ insertNode(tree, refNode, parentId, index)
    │       (the ref node has `componentId` prop set to the VC id)
    │
    ├─→ const vc = lookupComponent(componentId)
    ├─→ syncSlotInstances(refNode, vc, tree.nodes)
    │       → SyncResult { inserts, renames, deletes }
    └─→ applySlotSyncResult(tree.nodes, result)
})
```

Same pattern fires on:

- VC reference rebind (changing which VC a ref points to)
- VC author edits (adding / removing / renaming slots) — sync runs against every active ref

---

## Editing a VC (VC-mode)

The editor supports two modes — see [docs/editor.md](../editor.md):

| Mode    | What `mutateActiveTree(fn)` calls           | Tree                          |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `page`  | `fn(activePage)`                            | The active page's tree        |
| `vc`    | `fn(vc.tree as NodeTree<PageNode>)`         | The active VC's tree          |

The 11 named tree-mutation store actions work in both modes without branching. See [docs/reference/page-tree.md](../reference/page-tree.md).

Routing a VC into VC-mode goes through a "virtual page" wrapper:

`src/core/visualComponents/virtualPage.ts`:

- `flattenVCToVirtualPage(vc) → Page` — wraps the VC tree in a `Page`-shaped object so the editor's page-mode code paths work unchanged.
- `parseVirtualVCPageId(pageId) → vcId | null` — detects the virtual page id and returns the VC id.

This is why mutations don't need to branch — VC-mode looks like page-mode all the way down to `NodeTree`.

---

## Deletion impact

Deleting a VC has consequences across every page that references it. `src/core/visualComponents/deletionImpact.ts`:

```ts
previewVCDeletion(vcId, allPages) → VCDeletionImpact {
  references: VCRefUsage[]     // every ref on every page that points at this VC
}
```

The admin UI shows the impact list before confirming the delete, so the user can decide to leave the VC alone.

---

## Publisher integration

At render time, the publisher's `renderVisualComponentRef` runs when the walker hits a `base.visual-component-ref` node:

```text
renderVisualComponentRef(refNode, ctx, renderNode):
    │
    ├─→ vc = ctx.components.get(refNode.props.componentId)
    ├─→ build inner RenderContext with vc.tree as the active tree
    ├─→ resolve instanceProps from refNode.props (each VCParam.id → value)
    ├─→ recurse renderNode(vc.tree.rootNodeId, innerCtx) with prop-binding substitution
    ├─→ for each base.slot-outlet encountered in the VC tree:
    │     match its slotName to a base.slot-instance child of refNode in the OUTER tree
    │     render the slot-instance's children in the outer ctx
    │     substitute their rendered HTML at the outlet's position
    └─→ return composed HTML
```

The slot-outlet ↔ slot-instance pairing happens at render time, **not** at edit time — slot fills always live in the consumer page tree, so they edit freely; the publisher just bridges the two trees on render.

See [docs/features/publisher.md](publisher.md) for the broader pipeline.

## Cookbook

### Author a VC with a slot

1. Open the **Site → Components** panel, create a new VC.
2. In VC-mode, build the layout: containers, headings, etc.
3. Drop a **`base.slot-outlet`** at every position user content should be plugged in. Set its `slotName` (`'header'`, `'body'`, etc.).
4. Optionally seed the outlet with default child content — used the first time a consumer drops the ref.
5. Save.

When the VC is referenced on a page, the consumer sees one slot-instance per distinct `slotName`, each pre-filled with the outlet's default children.

### Add a typed parameter

1. In VC-mode, open the Parameters panel.
2. Add a param: name, type, defaultValue, required, enumOptions if `type === 'enum'`.
3. Pick the VC tree node whose prop should be bound. In the Properties Panel for that prop, choose **"Bind to param"** and select the param.
4. Save.

Consumers see a control for the param in the VC ref's Properties Panel (type-driven — `Input`, `Switch`, `Select`, `ColorInput`, etc.).

### Programmatically instantiate a VC

```ts
import { instantiateVCAtRef } from '@core/visualComponents'

const { refNode, slotInstances } = instantiateVCAtRef(vc, { /* instanceProps */ })
// refNode has props.componentId = vc.id and one slot-instance child per slot.
```

`instantiateVCAtRef` is what the editor uses internally when a ref is dropped. Plugins shipping a VC pack use it during install to materialize starter refs.

### Delete a VC safely

1. Call `previewVCDeletion(vcId, allPages)` to enumerate references.
2. Show the impact list in the UI; require confirmation.
3. On confirm, delete the VC row and delete every referencing ref node (and its subtree) from the affected pages in one transaction.

## Forbidden patterns

| Pattern                                                                | Use instead                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Storing slot content as a `slotContent` prop on the ref                | `base.slot-instance` children in the consumer page tree       |
| Looking up slots from `vc.params` instead of walking the VC tree       | `extractSlotNamesFromVCTree` / `syncSlotInstances`            |
| Mutating `slot-instance` children directly outside the consumer page   | They live in the consumer page tree — edit them there         |
| Binding a prop on a VC tree node to a literal value                    | The literal goes in `node.props`. Bindings are `propBindings` mapping prop → `{ paramId }`. |
| Looking up a param by `name`                                           | Use `id` — names can be renamed, ids are stable               |
| Inserting a ref without running `syncSlotInstances`                    | Always sync, even on first insert. `instantiateVCAtRef` does it for you. |
| Allowing recursive VC refs                                             | Call `wouldCreateCycle(...)` before insert / rebind           |
| Branching on `kind === 'visualComponent'` inside a tree mutation       | Mutations operate on `NodeTree<TNode>` — `mutateActiveTree` is the only branch (gated). |
