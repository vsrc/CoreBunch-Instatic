# Media

The Media workspace — a dedicated admin page for managing every file on the site. Folder tree, file grid, bulk operations, usage tracking, floating windows for upload queue / viewer / bulk edit. Lives at `/admin/media`.

The workspace is canvas-style: it uses `AdminWorkspaceCanvasLayout`, the lighter canvas shell shared by Content, Data, and Media. The sidebar is a panel rail with folder-tree navigation / storage controls; the canvas is an OS-style file manager grid driven by `MediaCanvas`, where folders and assets share the same browsing surface. Sidebar width and floating overlay positions are persisted through `workspaceLayoutStorage`.

---

## TL;DR

- **Route:** `/admin/media`, capability-gated by `media.manage`.
- **Page entrypoint:** `src/admin/pages/media/MediaPage.tsx`.
- **State:** one hook — `useMediaWorkspace()` — orchestrates folders, assets, selection, filters, upload queue, and folder moves. The editor store doesn't grow new slices; the Media page is self-contained.
- **Folders:** folders render as first-class grid/list items in the canvas. Opening a folder filters the canvas to its contents, and nested folders show a parent-folder entry to navigate back.
- **Drag/drop:** assets can be dragged into folders from the canvas or folder tree. A drop replaces the asset's folder memberships with the target folder, matching desktop file-manager move semantics.
- **Floating windows:** Asset viewer, upload queue, bulk edit. Each is `useDraggablePanel('mediaViewer' | 'mediaUploadQueue' | 'mediaBulkEdit')`. Position survives reload via `workspaceLayoutStorage`.
- **Auto-open behavior:** upload queue opens when uploads start; bulk-edit opens at 2+ selected; viewer opens on primary selection.
- **Server side:** `media_assets`, `media_folders`, `media_asset_folders` tables. Handlers under `/admin/api/cms/media`, `/admin/api/cms/media/folders`, `/admin/api/cms/media/storage`. Repositories at `server/repositories/media*.ts`.
- **Storage adapters:** built-in local-disk plus plugin-registered adapters. Non-public-url adapters route through `/_instatic/media/<adapterId>/<storagePath>` for signed redirects.

## Page architecture

```text
<AdminWorkspaceCanvasLayout>                         ← shared non-site canvas shell
  toolbar:                                           ← Upload + Bulk + … buttons
  sidebar: <MediaSidebar activePanel={…}>            ← Folders | Storage | Smart folders
  canvas:  <MediaCanvas …>                           ← folder + file grid / list
  overlays (floating windows):
    <MediaViewerWindow>     ← primary selection
    <UploadQueueWindow>     ← active uploads
    <BulkEditWindow>        ← 2+ selected
```

`MediaPage` orchestrates window visibility and reads `useMediaWorkspace()` for everything else. Window **position** lives in `workspaceLayoutStorage` (`useDraggablePanel(id)`). Window **visibility** is either derived from selection or held in local state — see "Floating windows" below.

### `useMediaWorkspace` — the orchestrator

A single hook returns the full workspace state:

```ts
const {
  folders,        // tree of folders + All files + Trash
  assets,         // current filter results
  selection,      // Set<assetId> + primary
  filter,         // type / folder / date / query
  upload,         // queue + progress
  // … plus actions: rename, move, delete, replace, tag, etc.
} = useMediaWorkspace()
```

The editor store does **not** grow new slices. The Media page is self-contained — it talks to the CMS API directly through the persistence layer, and its shared chrome state uses `src/admin/state/workspaceLayout.ts`.

### Folder navigation and moves

`MediaCanvas` treats folders as regular canvas items:

- In **All files**, root folders render before the full asset list; type/search/tag filters apply to assets globally, not only to root-level files.
- Inside a folder, immediate child folders render before assets, and a parent-folder item appears at the start of the grid/list.
- Type filters other than `All` and active tag filters hide folder items so filtering remains literal. Search still matches folder names when folders are visible.

Drag/drop logic is split across two layers:

- **`utils/mediaDragDrop.ts`** — TypeBox-validated `DataTransfer` payload read/write helpers. Declares the `MediaDropPayload` union (`{ kind: 'assets', assetIds }` | `{ kind: 'folder', folderId }`).
- **`utils/mediaDnd.ts`** — the single source of truth for drop-legality rules. Exports `canMoveFolderTo`, `canAcceptDrop`, and `commitDropPayload` as pure functions operating on a `MediaDndTarget` interface (folders, folderById, moveAssetsToFolder, moveFolder). Also exports `folderDropKey` and `ROOT_FOLDER_DROP_KEY` for the root sentinel.
- **`hooks/useMediaDnd.ts`** — wraps the rules with React state (active drop-target highlight) and returns `handleDragOver`, `handleDragLeave`, `handleDrop`, `isDropTarget`, and `clearDropTarget`. Both `MediaCanvas` and `MediaFolderPanel` consume this hook — no DnD logic is duplicated between the two surfaces. The hook accepts an `enabled` flag so read-only media users can browse without seeing internal move drop targets.

Drop rules enforced by `canMoveFolderTo`:

| Drop attempt | Allowed |
|---|---|
| Folder onto itself | No — self-drop |
| Folder onto its current parent | No — no-op move |
| Folder into one of its own descendants | No — cycle |
| Any other folder target | Yes |

Asset drops are accepted when the caller has `media.write`; `commitDropPayload` calls `moveAssetsToFolder(assetIds, targetFolderId)`. Dropping on **All files** moves assets/folders back to the root (`targetFolderId: null`).

The admin UI mirrors the server capability split:

- `media.read` can open the workspace, browse assets/folders, open the viewer, and copy public URLs.
- `media.write` exposes upload, metadata editing, rename, folder management, restore, bulk metadata edits, and internal folder/asset moves.
- `media.replace` exposes the Replace file action.
- `media.delete` exposes soft-delete and purge actions.

Storage remains `media_asset_folders` (many-to-many), but the canvas move interaction is intentionally file-manager-like: moving an asset to a folder removes its previous folder assignments and adds only the target folder. The user-facing model is one current folder per asset move.

### Smart folders

Smart folders are virtual views in the sidebar that match assets by predicate rather than by folder membership. They appear in the **Library** section of `MediaFolderPanel` (above the folder tree), alongside "All files", and use the same `FolderSelection` union type (`SmartFolderId`). The predicate for each ID lives in `src/admin/pages/media/utils/smartFolders.ts`.

| Smart folder ID          | Label               | Matches                                          | Scope       |
|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `smart:missing-alt`      | Missing alt text    | `altText.trim()` is empty                        | Images only |
| `smart:missing-title`    | Missing title       | `title.trim()` is empty                          | Images only |
| `smart:untagged`         | Untagged            | `tags` array is empty                            | All assets  |
| `smart:large-files`      | Large files         | `sizeBytes > 1 MiB`                              | All assets  |
| `smart:recently-replaced`| Recently replaced   | `replacedAt !== null`                            | All assets  |

"Images only" means the predicate short-circuits to `false` for any `mimeType` that doesn't start with `image/`. Fonts, documents, videos, and audio files are never matched by the image-metadata smart folders even when those fields are empty.

Standard filters (type chip, search, tag) still apply inside a smart folder view — `useMediaWorkspace` runs the smart predicate on top of the already-filtered list (`filteredAssets → visibleAssets`).

The count badge shown next to each smart folder in the sidebar is computed client-side from `workspace.assets` using `smartFolderPredicate(id)` directly — no extra server round-trip.

### Floating windows

Each floating window has a unique `FloatingPanelId` (`'mediaViewer' | 'mediaUploadQueue' | 'mediaBulkEdit'`), uses `useDraggablePanel(id)` for position, and gets its position persisted via `workspaceLayoutStorage.ts`. Visibility differs by window:

| Window          | How visibility is determined                                                                    |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MediaViewerWindow` | Derived during render: `selectedAssetId !== null && selectedAssetIds.size <= 1`. Closing clears the selection. No `useState`. |
| `BulkEditWindow`    | Derived during render: `selectedAssetIds.size >= 2`. Mutually exclusive with the viewer. No `useState`. |
| `UploadQueueWindow` | `uploadQueueOpen` in local `useState`. Auto-opens via `useEffect` when uploads start; stays open after completion until the user dismisses it. Toolbar button toggles it. |

The viewer and bulk-edit are derived rather than stored because "closed" is identical to "no selection" — every close path calls `workspace.clearSelection()`. Deriving avoids an extra render commit and the one-frame open lag that appeared with the old `setState`-in-effect approach.

The shared `FloatingWindow` shell at `components/FloatingWindow/` provides the chrome: drag handle, close button, position bounding.

## Data model

Media data lives in dedicated tables (not in `data_tables` — they predate the universal store and have media-specific columns and a public-path index).

### `media_assets`

| Column                | Type (PG)     | Type (SQLite)   | Notes                                                                                           |

| `storage_path`        | `text`        | `text`          | Adapter-internal handle (local basename or S3 key). Never exposed to the browser.              |
| `storage_adapter_id`  | `text`        | `text`          | Id of the adapter that wrote this asset. Empty string = built-in local-disk.                   |
| `externally_hosted`   | `boolean`     | `integer` (0/1) | True when bytes live outside the host's `uploads/` dir (`'public-url'` adapters).              |
| `uploaded_by_user_id` | `text`        | `text`          | Nullable FK to `users`.                                                                         |

| `title`               | `text`        | `text`          | Optional; falls back to filename                                                                |
| `tags_json`           | `jsonb`       | `text`          | `string[]`, sorted lowercase                                                                    |

| `dominant_color`      | `text`        | `text`          | Nullable, `#rrggbb`. Computed server-side on upload                                             |
| `blur_hash`           | `text`        | `text`          | Nullable. Used for skeleton placeholders                                                        |
| `variants_json`       | `jsonb`       | `text`          | `MediaVariant[]` — each entry carries `width`, `height`, `format`, `path`, `sizeBytes`, `storagePath`, `storageAdapterId` |
| `poster_path`         | `text`        | `text`          | Nullable. URL for video poster frame                                                            |
| `deleted_at`          | `timestamptz` | `text`          | Nullable. Non-null = soft-deleted (in Trash)                                                    |
| `replaced_at`         | `timestamptz` | `text`          | Nullable. Set when binary is swapped via "Replace file"                                         |
| `created_at`          | `timestamptz` | `text`          |                                                                                                 |

### `media_folders`

```sql
create table media_folders (
  id text primary key,
  parent_id text references media_folders(id) on delete cascade,
  name text not null,
  slug text not null,
  sort_order integer not null default 0,
  created_by_user_id text references users(id) on delete set null,
  created_at timestamptz not null default current_timestamp,
  unique (parent_id, slug)
)
```

Slug auto-generated from name. `parent_id IS NULL` = root folder. Uniqueness scoped per parent, so two "Logos" folders under different parents are allowed.

### `media_asset_folders` (many-to-many)

```sql
create table media_asset_folders (
  asset_id text not null references media_assets(id) on delete cascade,
  folder_id text not null references media_folders(id) on delete cascade,
  primary key (asset_id, folder_id)
)
create index media_asset_folders_folder_idx on media_asset_folders (folder_id)
```

Assets with no folder rows are root-level assets. The **All files** view still includes every active asset, while drag/drop onto **All files** clears folder membership and moves the asset back to the root.

JSON columns end in `_json` per the convention — see [docs/reference/database-dialects.md](../reference/database-dialects.md).

## Server side

### Handlers

| Handler                          | Routes                                                     |

| `server/handlers/cms/mediaUpload.ts`, `mediaUploadDispatch.ts`, `mediaUploadExecutor.ts` | `POST /admin/api/cms/media/upload` + dispatcher / executor pipeline |

Folder routes (`/admin/api/cms/media/folders/...`) are matched **before** asset routes (`/admin/api/cms/media/:id`) because the latter would otherwise eat them. Same for storage routes (`/admin/api/cms/media/storage/...`). See `server/handlers/cms/index.ts`.

SVG uploads are sanitized and stored as originals only. GIF uploads also stay original-only so animation is preserved; the responsive WebP ladder is generated only for JPEG, PNG, and WebP uploads.

The ladder encodes one WebP per target width (64 / 320 / 640 / 1024 / 1600 / 2048) **below** the source's intrinsic width — never upscaled — plus one rung **at** the intrinsic width. That top rung exists so `srcset` can be built from variants alone: the original file (often a multi-MB PNG) never appears as a srcset candidate, because a high-DPI display asking for more pixels than the largest sub-intrinsic rung would otherwise select it (`sizes="1280px"` on a 2x screen requests 2560 device px). `buildMediaSrcset` (publisher) and `buildVariantSrcset` (admin surfaces) both enforce the variants-only rule at render time. The `sizes` attribute has no user knob: the publisher's `resolveAutoSizes` (`src/core/publisher/sizesResolver.ts`) derives it from the layout it generates the CSS for — pixel caps, `%`/`vw` widths, px paddings, and grid column tracks all compose into exact CSS math per viewport tier (e.g. `(max-width: 375px) 100vw, min(33.33vw - 16px, 410.67px)`); constructs it can't model (flex rows, auto-fit grids) degrade to the container width, which only ever over-fetches, never blurs. Lazy images prefix the `auto` keyword so Chromium-based browsers select by the actual rendered width.

Ladder edge rules: the intrinsic rung is clamped so neither output dimension exceeds WebP's hard 16383px cap (a 900×17000 screenshot gets a clamped top rung instead of a failed job); images smaller than every target width get **no variants** and publish as plain pixel-exact `src` (small icons are never force-re-encoded to lossy WebP). The Tier-3 delegate path emits **declared widths only** — the host never synthesizes an intrinsic-width URL the delegate's allowlist might reject; the largest declared sub-intrinsic width is that ladder's ceiling.

The image-variant worker pool is sized by `IMAGE_VARIANT_WORKER_POOL_SIZE` (default 2, hard cap 8). Workers are spawned lazily on first use and reused for the life of the process; a crashed worker is dropped from the pool and a replacement spawns on the next submission.

Defense in depth on the static path: `hardenUploadResponse` in `server/static.ts` adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Content-Disposition: attachment` for non-inert MIME types so a stray non-allowlisted upload can't be top-level navigated and rendered as HTML on the admin origin.

### Storage adapters

Built-in: local-disk (`mediaStorageRegistry.configureLocalDisk(...)` at boot). Plugin-registered: adapters added via the plugin SDK with their own `getReadUrl` / write semantics.

Two serving modes:

- **`public-url`** — the adapter returns a public URL the browser hits directly (or via CDN). Used by local-disk (`/uploads/...`).
- **non–`public-url`** — the asset URL is host-owned (`/_instatic/media/<adapterId>/<storagePath>`); the browser hits the host, which 302-redirects to a freshly-signed read URL.

The redirect handler is `tryServeMediaRedirect` in `server/router.ts`. The redirect target has a 1-hour TTL — long enough for browser fetches, short enough that a leaked signed URL becomes useless fast.

## Adding a new feature to the Media page

### Add a new column to `media_assets`

1. Add the column to both `server/db/migrations-pg.ts` and `migrations-sqlite.ts` with the same migration ID.
2. JSON column → name ends in `_json`.
3. In `server/repositories/mediaAssetMapping.ts`:
   - Add the column to `MEDIA_ASSET_COLUMNS`.
   - Add it to `MediaAssetRow`.
   - Map it in `mapMediaAssetRow()`.
   If it's also written at create time, add it to `MEDIA_ASSET_INSERT_COLUMNS` and the `CreateMediaAssetInput` in `server/repositories/media.ts`.
4. If the column is client-visible, extend the wire schema in `src/core/persistence/cmsMedia.ts` (`CmsMediaAssetWire`) and add the field to `normalizeCmsMediaAsset()`.
5. Add a setter handler in `server/handlers/cms/media.ts` if the field is user-editable.
6. Expose it in the asset viewer (`MediaViewerWindow`) and bulk-edit window (`BulkEditWindow`) if appropriate.

### Add a new floating window

1. Add a unique id to `FloatingPanelId` in the layout storage module.
2. Create `components/<WindowName>/` with the window React component using the shared `FloatingWindow` shell.
3. Use `useDraggablePanel('newWindowId')` for position; track `open` in `MediaPage` local state.
4. Add the auto-open rule (selection threshold, upload event, etc.) inside `MediaPage`.

### Add a new sidebar panel

1. Add the panel id to `MediaSidebarPanelId` in `components/MediaSidebar/MediaSidebar.tsx`.
2. Render the panel body inside the sidebar conditional.
3. Add the rail button: use `assignRailAccents` from `@ui/railAccent` to derive tints for the full rail item list (avoids repeats), then pass the resolved accent as `--rail-icon-tint` via an inline CSS custom property on the button. See `MediaSidebar.tsx` for the pattern.

### Register a plugin storage adapter

See [docs/features/plugin-system.md](plugin-system.md). The plugin SDK's `api.cms.media.registerStorageAdapter(adapter)` (under `unstable.internals` today) provides the registration surface. Adapters declare a `servingMode` and either return public URLs or implement `getReadUrl(storagePath, ttlSeconds)` for signed redirects.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Storing media metadata as JSON on the page tree                      | `media_assets` row with a foreign key                       |
| Hardcoding `/uploads/...` URLs in modules                            | Use the asset's `public_path` (the host owns the URL shape) |
| Filling `<img>` `srcset` manually                                    | Use `variants_json` + the publisher's `mediaPresentation.ts`|
| Adding a docked panel to the Media page                              | Use a floating window — Media is canvas-style by design     |
| Calling `api.cms.media.*` from a plugin without `unstable.internals` | Adapter registration is still gated to first-party plugins  |
| Treating `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` rows as gone                       | They're in Trash; restore is supported until purge          |
| Skipping `parent_id, slug` uniqueness when creating folders          | The unique constraint enforces it — handle the error path   |
