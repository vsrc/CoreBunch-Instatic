/**
 * Publisher — render config, accumulators, and the value types they carry.
 *
 * Every recursive call into a renderer is threaded with TWO explicit shapes,
 * separating roles that used to be conflated in a single god-object:
 *
 *  - `RenderConfig` (read-only): the inputs of a render pass — page, site,
 *    registry, breakpoint, template context, pre-fetched I/O (loop data,
 *    media assets), and the static classification / annotation flags. Every
 *    field is `readonly`; collections are `ReadonlyMap` / `ReadonlySet`. A
 *    renderer that needs a different page or template frame (VC ref, loop
 *    iteration) constructs a NEW child config — it never mutates the one it
 *    received.
 *
 *  - `RenderAccumulators` (mutable): the outputs of a render pass — the
 *    deduped CSS map, the set of infinite-loop ids, and the set of nodes that
 *    actually emitted a `<instatic-hole>`. The top-level `publishPage` owns
 *    these, initialises all three up-front, and threads the SAME instances
 *    down the whole tree so every renderer appends to one shared accumulator.
 *    Passing it as an explicit parameter is what makes the shared-mutable
 *    output visible at each call site.
 *
 * Pulling the shapes into their own file lets the standard renderer
 * (`renderNode.ts`), the specialised renderers (`renderVisualComponentRef.ts`,
 * `renderLoop.ts`), and the page orchestrator (`render.ts`) all import the
 * same types without circular dependencies.
