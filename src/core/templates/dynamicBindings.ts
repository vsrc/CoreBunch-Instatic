/**
 * Dynamic prop binding — resolves runtime values from the publisher's
 * entry stack into a node's static props at render time.
 *
 * The stack semantics are the heart of how templates compose with loops:
 *  - The publisher seeds the stack with the page's primary entry when
 *    rendering a single-entry content template.
 *  - The `base.loop` renderer renders each iteration against a fresh child
 *    `RenderConfig` whose `entryStack` is an immutable snapshot
 *    (`[...baseStack, item]`) — there is no in-place push/pop on a shared
 *    array, so a nested loop or VC ref in the body sees a stable per-iteration
 *    stack.
 *  - `dynamicBindings.source: 'currentEntry'` always reads the stack top,
 *    i.e. "the closest enclosing entity". Inside a loop nested in a
 *    template, that's the loop iteration; outside the loop it's still
 *    the template entry.
 *  - `dynamicBindings.source: 'parentEntry'` reads one frame below the
 *    top — useful inside a loop nested in a template, where you want to
 *    refer to the outer template entry from inside an iteration.
 *
 * Field lookup is generic: each `LoopItem` carries a `fields` map, and
 * the resolver simply reads `fields[binding.field]`. Format coercions
 * (e.g. markdown → HTML for body bindings with `format: 'html'`) happen
 * here as a thin shim so already-persisted bindings keep working without
 * the source needing to pre-render every variant.

/**
 * Resolve a single binding to its runtime value.
 *
 * Dispatch by source:
 *   - `currentEntry` / `parentEntry` — read from the entry stack
 *     (top / second-from-top).
 *   - `page` / `site` / `route` — read from the corresponding
 *     named frame on the context.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for fields that don't exist on the resolved frame
 * (or when the requested frame doesn't exist) — the caller decides
 * whether to fall back to the static prop or substitute an empty value.
 *
 * Field paths are dotted (`author.name`, `parent.slug`). The first
 * segment opens against the frame; subsequent segments walk plain
 * objects via `walkFieldPath`. Relation traversal is represented as ordinary
 * multi-segment paths against `currentEntry`.
 *
 * `readFrame` / `walkFieldPath` are shared with the token interpolator
 * — both live in `./tokenInterpolation.ts` to avoid duplication.
