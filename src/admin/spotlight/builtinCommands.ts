/**
 * builtinCommands — the cached aggregation of every built-in spotlight
 * command, separated from `commandRegistry.ts` so scopes (`rootScope.ts`
 * etc.) can call `getAllCommands()` without re-importing the registry.
 *
 * Why this lives in its own file:
 *   - `commandRegistry.ts` statically imports every scope (so the scope
 *     registry can be built at module load).
 *   - `rootScope.ts` needs `getAllCommands` to populate its commands list.
 *   - If `getAllCommands` lived in `commandRegistry.ts`, those two files
 *     would form a static import cycle: registry imports rootScope,
 *     rootScope imports registry.
 *
 * Splitting the command aggregator out of the scope registry removes the
 * cycle. `commandRegistry.ts` still re-exports `getAllCommands` for the
 * rest of the spotlight surface; new callers should import from here.

/**
 * Module-level cache of the STATIC built-in command list. Each
 * `getXxxCommands()` factory creates fresh `Command` objects on every call;
 * caching the array here guarantees stable command references across renders.
 * Stable references are critical for `mergedFlatList.indexOf(cmd)` to work
 * in keyboard-navigation index tracking — without this, the highlighted row
 * tracking and `getCommandAtIndex` would never line up.
 *
 * Plugin commands are NOT cached here — `getPluginsCommands()` reads the
 * plugin runtime each call, so newly-registered plugins surface immediately
 * without a palette restart. The runtime maintains stable per-plugin command
 * references between registrations, so identity-based row matching still
 * works in practice (a plugin re-registering the same id during a session
 * is rare and would invalidate identity anyway).
