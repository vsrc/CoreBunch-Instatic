/**
 * adminUi — admin-shell-wide UI state, intentionally kept small and
 * independent of the editor store.
 *
 * The editor store (`@site/store/store`) carries 12 slices and weighs
 * ~165 KB in its own chunk. Any module that subscribes to it transitively
 * drags that chunk into its graph. AdminPageLayout (Plugins / Users /
 * Account / plugin admin pages) only needs a few cross-shell signals —
 * specifically the "settings modal open" flag — and reading them from the
 * editor store made every non-editor admin page eagerly download the full
 * editor toolchain.
 *
 * This store lives outside `@site/` so the admin shell can subscribe
 * without pulling in any editor-only modules. The editor's
 * `settingsSlice` mirrors its open/close events into this store (see
 * `src/admin/pages/site/store/slices/settingsSlice.ts`), so editor and
 * admin views stay in sync without either one becoming dependent on
 * the other.
 *
 * Keep this store TINY. If a piece of state is only relevant inside the
 * canvas (selection, panels, breakpoints, …), it belongs in the editor
 * store. If admin pages outside the canvas need to read it, it belongs
 * here.
