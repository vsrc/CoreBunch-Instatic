/**
 * urlState — workspace-agnostic primitives for making an admin view's current
 * selection directly linkable through the URL query string.
 *
 * Two halves of the same contract:
 *
 *   - `useInitialQueryParams()` — read the params present when the view first
 *     mounted (for one-shot "open this thing on load" deep links).
 *   - `useUrlQuerySync()`       — mirror the current selection back into the URL
 *     so a reload / bookmark / shared link reopens the same view.
 *
 * Both operate on `window.location` / `window.history` directly rather than the
 * admin router. That's deliberate:
 *   - The visual editor (`src/admin/pages/site/`) is forbidden from importing
 *     the router (Phase F embeddability), but still needs linkable pages — a
 *     window-based primitive is the one mechanism all workspaces can share.
 *   - Selection changes only ever touch the query string, never the pathname,
 *     so the router's route match must NOT re-run. Writing via `replaceState`
 *     without dispatching the router's `pb:locationchange` event keeps the
 *     route stable while the address bar stays current.
 *
 * `replaceState` (never `pushState`) is used so flipping between rows/pages
 * doesn't flood the browser's back stack with intermediate selections.
