/**
 * `prewarmedLazy` — React.lazy alternative with two properties React.lazy
 * lacks: an explicit `.preload()` trigger and a synchronous-render fast
 * path once the module is loaded.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * A `React.lazy` loader that chains off a dynamic page import has a subtle
 * bug for our use case: the loader returns a NEW `.then()` chain every time React
 * calls it. Even when the underlying module is fully cached by the
 * browser AND populated in V8's module map, `.then` is a microtask —
 * React's reconciler sees a pending promise and renders the Suspense
 * fallback for ONE tick before the chain resolves. For workspace
 * navigation (Dashboard ↔ Site ↔ Content ↔ ...), that one-tick
 * fallback flashes as a "loading screen flicker" on every nav click.
 *
 * What this does instead
 * ----------------------
 * - Exposes an explicit `.preload()` method on the wrapped component.
 *   Calling `MyPage.preload()` fires the dynamic import immediately
 *   and caches the resolved component. Subsequent calls are no-ops.
 *
 * - The loader is NOT auto-fired at construction time. The active page
 *   loads when React renders it (the render path calls `preload()`
 *   itself via Suspense). The OTHER pages stay dormant until something
 *   explicitly calls `MyOtherPage.preload()`.
 *
 *   This is what unlocks the prioritization the previous design was
 *   missing: the page the user is actually viewing loads alone (no
 *   8 sibling compilations stealing dev-server CPU), then the host
 *   triggers background preloads for the rest AFTER the active page
 *   has painted.
 *
 * - First render before the load resolves: throws the pending promise
 *   so the nearest `<Suspense>` boundary shows its fallback. Same UX
 *   as React.lazy on the cold path.
 *
 * - Subsequent renders: returns the cached component DIRECTLY via
 *   `createElement(Cached, props)`. No microtask, no Suspense, no
 *   fallback flash. The navigation feels instant.
 *
 * Cost model
 * ----------
 * AuthenticatedAdmin's chunk is unchanged — wrapped pages stay as
 * separate chunks (the loader uses `import()` which Vite/Rolldown
 * keeps lazy-bundled). What's eager is the host scheduling: the
 * active page when it mounts, the others scheduled when the host
 * decides (idle callback after first paint, typically).
 *
 * The pattern is a direct port of `react-loadable` / `loadable-
 * components`' "preload + synchronous render" strategy, adapted for
 * React 19. The official future-direction in React 19 is the `use()`
 * hook, but it still triggers Suspense on first read; the synchronous
 * fast-path here is what eliminates the second-and-onwards flash.
