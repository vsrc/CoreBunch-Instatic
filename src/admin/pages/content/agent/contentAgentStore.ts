/**
 * Content-workspace agent store — a small standalone Zustand instance
 * holding ONLY the AgentSlice. Composed per ContentPage mount via
 * `createContentAgentStore(currentUser)`.
 *
 * Why standalone (not part of a bigger content store): the content
 * workspace is built on React hooks, not Zustand, so there's no parent
 * store to compose into. Building a content workspace store JUST for the
 * agent would be overkill — a per-mount tiny Zustand instance with one
 * slice is the smallest correct shape.
 *
 * Why per-mount (not module-level like useEditorStore): the content page
 * mounts/unmounts as the user navigates between admin pages; rebuilding
 * the store each mount keeps memory in check and ensures stale snapshot
 * closures don't survive a logout / user-swap. The site editor's store
 * is module-level because the editor session is the entire admin
 * lifetime, which doesn't apply here.
