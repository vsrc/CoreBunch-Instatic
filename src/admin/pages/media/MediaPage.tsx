/**
 * MediaPage — the dedicated Media workspace.
 *
 * Canvas-style admin shell through AdminWorkspaceCanvasLayout. Folder tree in
 * the left sidebar, file grid/list in the canvas. Every interactive overlay —
 * the asset viewer, the upload queue, the bulk-edit pane — is a floating
 * window (per design: no docked right rail on this page).
 *
 * Window visibility lives in local state here; `useDraggablePanel` only owns
 * each window's POSITION via `workspaceLayoutStorage`. The upload queue
 * auto-opens when something starts uploading; the bulk-edit window
 * auto-opens once the user has 2+ assets selected; the viewer opens whenever
 * the user has a primary selection.
