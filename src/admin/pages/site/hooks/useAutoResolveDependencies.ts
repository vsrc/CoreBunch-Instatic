/**
 * useAutoResolveDependencies — keep the site's runtime state in lockstep
 * with the editor's draft `packageJson` + runtime cache contents.
 *
 * Triggers a resolve when any of these go out of sync:
 *
 *   • Lock is out of date — a dep was added, removed, or its requested
 *     range changed. Debounces so a burst of `setDependency` calls
 *     (e.g. inserting a module that declares peer deps) collapses into
 *     one resolution.
 *   • Importmap is missing while the lock is populated — happens after
 *     opening a site whose state was persisted before the importmap
 *     surface existed, or when the server skipped the install step on
 *     the previous resolve (network blip mid-flight). Without this the
 *     editor's iframe sandbox would render with an empty import map and
 *     plugins would see "TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier".
 *
 * The resolution itself is a store action (`resolveDependencyLock`) so the
 * Dependencies Panel reads the same status the auto-resolve produces.
 * Failures surface through `dependencyResolveStatus = 'error'` but don't
 * throw — a network blip shouldn't crash the editor.
 *
 * Mounted from `SitePage` so the loop runs whenever the visual editor is
 * open, regardless of whether the Dependencies Panel itself is visible.
