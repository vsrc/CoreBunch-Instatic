/**
 * resolveInsertLocation — shared "where should a new node land?" resolver.
 *
 * Every UI flow that inserts a node relative to a user-clicked target (toolbar
 * picker, canvas right-click, DOM-panel right-click, clipboard paste, etc.)
 * resolves the actual parent + insertion index the same way:
 *
 *   - The page root and any module declaring `canHaveChildren: true` accept
 *     children. The new node is appended as the target's last child.
 *   - Anything else (Text, Button, Image, an opaque slot-instance, etc.) is a
 *     leaf — the new node is inserted as the *next sibling* under the
 *     target's parent. Without this fallback the right-click "Insert module
 *     here" / paste actions silently no-op on leaf targets.
 *
 *   - Visual-Component refs are containers in the tree sense (their
 *     slot-instance children are managed by the editor), but user-authored
 *     content goes inside the FIRST slot-instance, not as a direct child of
 *     the ref. We redirect into that slot here so callers don't have to
 *     repeat the logic. A VC ref WITHOUT any slot-instances (the component
 *     declares no slot params) is treated as a leaf — there is no addressable
 *     place to nest user content, so we fall through to sibling-after under
 *     the ref's parent. The earlier behaviour of returning null silently
 *     no-op'd every right-click "Insert module here" / paste on a slotless
 *     VC ref, which read as a broken click in the editor.
