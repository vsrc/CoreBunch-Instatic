/**
 * DashboardPage — `/admin/dashboard`.
 *
 * The admin home. Renders:
 *   • A page header with a personal greeting + Publish / Customize / New
 *     page actions.
 *   • The setup onboarding panel (wired to live CMS state via
 *     `useOnboardingState`). Per-user dismissed / collapsed in
 *     localStorage.
 *   • A configurable widget grid (12 columns). Customize mode shows drag
 *     handles + resize handles per widget + the bottom Block library.
 *
 * Widgets come from `dashboardWidgetRegistry` — first-party widgets are
 * registered on mount via `registerFirstPartyDashboardWidgets`; plugins
 * that hold the `dashboard.widgets.register` permission contribute
 * additional widgets through the SDK.
 *
 * Drag-and-drop topology
 * ----------------------
 * The page owns the `DndContext` so two sibling DnD surfaces can share
 * the same dnd-kit session:
 *
 *   1. The dashboard grid registers itself as a single droppable
 *      (`GRID_DROP_ID`); every grid cell that is `useDraggable` becomes
 *      a "move" source.
 *   2. The bottom-docked `BlockLibrary` registers each preview tile as
 *      `useDraggable` with id `library:<widgetId>` — a separate source
 *      class that the page-level `onDragEnd` distinguishes from the
 *      regular cell-move case.
 *
 * On drag end the page snaps the dragged element's translated bounding
 * rect to the nearest grid cell and either calls `moveWidget(id, col, row)`
 * (for in-grid moves) or `addWidget(id, size, rows, col, row)` (for
 * library drops).
 *
 * Routes into the editor through the existing soft-nav helpers so the
 * Site editor's heavy bundle doesn't load on the dashboard.

            • Expanded panel: lifecycle tied to `panelOpen` only, with
              slide-up / slide-down animations via `useDelayedUnmount`.
              Hidden via CSS (no exit animation) while a drag is in
              progress so the pill can take its place.
            • Minimized pill: mounted only while a drag is active.
              Mounts with `pillIn` animation, unmounts instantly — no
              exit animation, so a grid-to-grid move doesn't flash a
              "library closing" animation for a library the user never
              opened.

            Gated behind `mounted` so this heavyweight subtree (577 LOC,
            multiple `useDelayedUnmount` instances, plenty of dnd-kit
            droppable/draggable hooks) is omitted from the first
            reconciliation pass. It mounts on the next animation frame
            via the effect above. */}

          visible in either mode — the expanded panel owns the "Add
          block" affordance, and the minimized pill owns the drag
          interaction. The floating bar only appears when neither is on
          screen (i.e., customize mode is on but the user hasn't opened
          the library and isn't currently dragging).

          Gated behind `mounted` — the toolbar starts at `open={false}`
          on first paint anyway (editing defaults to false), so the
          component would render nothing visible but still allocate its
          portal root + animation state. Deferring it spares the first
