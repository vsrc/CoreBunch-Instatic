/**
 * Architecture Gate — Module size budgets
 *
 * Caps the line count of individual source modules. The codebase already
 * gates structure exhaustively (import boundaries, design tokens, DB dialect
 * parity, primitive usage, bundle size). The one dimension nothing gated was
 * *mass*: structure stayed clean while individual modules silently grew into
 * 1000-line god-files — exactly the modules where every feature lands, where
 * parallel sessions collide, and where bugs hide.
 *
 * This gate closes that gap. It is the per-module sibling of
 * `bundle-size-budgets.test.ts`: a static cap that catches the
 * silent-regression case, plus a grandfathered ledger of the modules that
 * were already over the line when the gate landed.
 *
 * Two mechanisms
 * --------------
 * 1. CEILING — no NEW source module may exceed {@link CEILING} lines. A file
 *    that crosses it is a god-file being born; split it by responsibility
 *    before it calcifies. (If a new module genuinely cannot be split — a
 *    generated table, an exhaustive switch — add it to GRANDFATHERED with a
 *    one-line justification, same as raising a bundle cap.)
 *
 * 2. GRANDFATHERED — the modules already over CEILING when this gate landed,
 *    each frozen at its current size. This is a **ratchet, not a freeze**:
 *      - a grandfathered file may shrink freely but MUST NOT grow past its
 *        recorded cap (adding lines forces you to extract first);
 *      - when it shrinks by more than {@link RATCHET_SLACK} lines below its
 *        cap, the gate fails asking you to lower the recorded number — so the
 *        ratchet actually tightens over time instead of leaking;
 *      - once it drops to CEILING or below, the gate fails asking you to
 *        delete its entry entirely (it has graduated and is now held by the
 *        normal CEILING rule).
 *
 * Why line count, not cyclomatic complexity
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Line count is the honest, unambiguous, zero-dependency proxy. It needs no
 * AST, never disagrees with `wc -l`, and a 1000-line module is a problem
 * regardless of how branchy it is. A cyclomatic-complexity gate is a fine
 * future addition — it would live in a sibling file — but this gate
 * deliberately measures the thing it can measure without interpretation.
 *
 * Append-only ledgers are exempt
 * ------------------------------
 * The two migration files grow by design — CLAUDE.md mandates appending a
 * new migration to BOTH on every schema change. Capping them would punish
 * correct behavior, so they are exempt entirely rather than grandfathered.
 *
 * Counting convention
 * -------------------
 * Lines == number of newline characters in the file, identical to `wc -l`.
 * The recorded caps below were captured with `wc -l`.
 *
 * @see bundle-size-budgets.test.ts — sibling gate (output size, not source size)
