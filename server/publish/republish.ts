/**
 * Background republish primitives.
 *
 * Called from the plugin API surface `api.cms.pages.republish(pageId)` and
 * `api.cms.pages.republishAll()`. These drive the full publish pipeline
 * (publish.before → publish.html filter → publish.after) for already-
 * published pages, without writing a new snapshot. The side-effects — hook
 * listeners and filter handlers firing — are the whole point.
 *
 * Note on the synthetic URL: `renderPublishedSnapshot` accepts an optional
 * `url` on its context for per-loop pagination and `{route.*}` binding
 * resolution. For background republish (not driven by an inbound HTTP
 * request), we pass a synthetic localhost URL so the renderer has a valid
 * URL object to work with. The URL is not user-visible and its exact value
 * is irrelevant beyond being parseable.
