/**
 * Publish-time process state for the publishing pipeline.
 *
 * This module owns the three pieces of cross-request publish state that are
 * NOT the render-cache LRU itself:
 *
 *   1. `publishVersion` — the monotonic counter bumped on every publish commit.
 *      `renderCache` reads it for staleness; Layer C hole placeholders stamp it;
 *      the hole endpoint compares against it. Repositories bump it after a
 *      publish/unpublish.
 *   2. `withPublishLock` — the in-process serializer that prevents two
 *      publishes' read-version → bake → bump-version windows from overlapping
 *      (ISS-038).
 *   3. `createVersionedSingleFlight` — a generalized version-keyed single-flight
 *      memo. One concurrent loader runs per version; the resolved value is
 *      cached until the version changes. Used by the render cache's siblings
 *      (e.g. the hole endpoint's published-snapshot memo) so none of them have
 *      to hand-roll their own module-level cache + in-flight pair + test reset.
 *
 * Keeping this out of `renderCache.ts` removes the repository → render-cache
 * coupling (repositories only need the version + the lock, not the LRU) and
 * gives every version-keyed memo one shared reset hook for tests.
