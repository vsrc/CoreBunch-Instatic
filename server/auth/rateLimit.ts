/**
 * Sliding-window rate limiter — in-memory, per-process.
 *
 * Used to throttle login attempts on `/admin/api/cms/login`. The bucket key is a
 * `(client-ip, email)` tuple so a single attacker IP can be slowed down even
 * across many target accounts, AND a single account can be defended against
 * across many attacker IPs.
 *
 * Storage is a `Map<key, number[]>` of attempt timestamps. Old entries fall
 * out of the window lazily on each access; `consume()` additionally runs an
 * opportunistic full prune — every `PRUNE_INTERVAL` calls, or as soon as the
 * map exceeds `PRUNE_SIZE_THRESHOLD` keys — so attacker-controlled
 * `(ip, email)` keys that go quiet cannot grow the map unbounded in a
 * long-lived process. The common path stays allocation-free: one counter
 * bump and a size check.
 *
 * Why in-memory instead of Redis or a DB table?
 *   - The CMS deploys as a single Bun process (the SQLite trade-off applies
 *     equally to PG-backed deployments — admin login is rare, single-writer).
 *   - No external dep, no extra container.
 *   - Counter loss on restart is acceptable: an attacker who waits for a
 *     restart still has to start over from scratch on the next attempt set.
