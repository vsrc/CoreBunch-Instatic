/**
 * mediaVariants — server-side responsive image + BlurHash pipeline.
 *
 * Coordinates a single upload's variant generation:
 *
 *   1. Decide whether to run the local ladder. When a Tier-3 variant
 *      delegate (Cloudflare Images / Imgix / Bunny Optimizer / …) is
 *      elected we skip local sharp encoding entirely and emit
 *      URL-template variants pointing at the delegate's service.
 *   2. Hand the source bytes to a `Bun.Worker` (see
 *      `imageVariantWorkerHost.ts`) which probes intrinsic dimensions,
 *      encodes a BlurHash placeholder, and — when the local ladder is
 *      in use — produces one WebP per target width.
 *   3. Stream each returned variant through `dispatchUpload(role:
 *      'variant')` so plugin storage adapters receive bytes for variants
 *      the same way they do for originals.
 *
 * **Why the worker:** sharp + libvips on a typical 4 MP JPEG is ~200–500 ms
 * of CPU on the main thread, which blocks every visitor request and the
 * admin API for the duration. Offloading to a `Bun.Worker` keeps the main
 * thread free while uploads serialise inside the pool. The host is still
 * the only side with a DB client and storage-adapter access — the worker
 * just does the CPU work.
 *
 * The default local-disk adapter writes each WebP next to the original at
 * `<uploadsDir>/<originalStem>-w<width>.webp`. The dispatch step is
 * adapter-agnostic; this module never touches the filesystem directly.
