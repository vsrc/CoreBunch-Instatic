/**
 * User preferences repository — CRUD over the `user_preferences` table.
 *
 * One row per (user_id, key). `value_json` carries the JSON-serialised
 * preference payload — the column suffix `_json` triggers the SQLite
 * adapter's auto-stringify on write + auto-parse on read, so this file
 * passes plain JS objects in both directions and the dialect adapter
 * handles the serialisation transparently (see CLAUDE.md "Database
 * dialect rules").
 *
 * Schema validation lives at the HTTP boundary, not in this repository.
 * The handler validates incoming payloads against the per-key TypeBox
 * schemas in `src/core/persistence/userPreferences.ts` before this
 * repository ever sees them, and re-validates on read. We pass `unknown`
 * around inside the repo so the type system doesn't lie about contents.
