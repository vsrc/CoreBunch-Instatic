# Changelog

All notable changes to Instatic will be documented here.

This project is pre-1.0. Breaking changes may appear in minor or patch releases until a stable release line exists.

## Unreleased

## 0.0.3 - 2026-06-10

- Hardened the plugin QuickJS sandbox against hangs: interrupt deadlines on plugin-source and timer execution, a host-side worker RPC timeout, and preserved VM stack traces in server logs.
- Made plugin `fetch` and plugin HTTP routes binary-safe end to end (byte-exact request/response bodies, including multipart uploads).
- Plugin settings saved in the admin UI (or via `settings.replace`) now propagate to the running plugin VM immediately, without a reload.
- Fixed plugin scheduler correctness: schedule cancellation, pause persistence across restarts, no firing for disabled plugins, and a sweep for orphaned schedules.
- Plugin-emitted hook events are now namespaced to `plugin.<id>.*`, so a plugin can no longer forge core or other plugins' events.
- Required a dedicated `editor.code` permission for unsandboxed admin-window plugin code, and the install review dialog now always shows.
- Secret plugin settings are masked on every client-facing payload and encrypted at rest in a dedicated `plugin_secrets` table using `INSTATIC_SECRET_KEY`.
- Added a force-uninstall escape hatch for plugins with failing lifecycle hooks, and run `deactivate` before `uninstall`.
- Decoupled the CSRF origin check from proxy trust: it now uses `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` (auto-detected from `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` / `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` on managed platforms), and `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` is now used only for client-IP attribution. Removed blanket `0.0.0.0/0` proxy trust from the deploy templates.
- Refreshed deployment docs and one-click templates (`TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`, `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, `RAILWAY_RUN_UID`, template-generated `INSTATIC_SECRET_KEY`).
- Fixed the data-table step-up authentication flow and revamped the README.

## 0.0.2 - 2026-06-09

- Added public repository community files and contribution workflow docs.
- Tightened forwarded-origin handling so `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` are trusted only from configured proxy peers.
- Added Render deployment blueprints and refreshed public deployment docs.
- Improved static site import fidelity, including imported runtime behavior and CSS cascade isolation.
- Added editable HTML attributes and path-derived Site Explorer organization.
- Hardened plugin media handling, public forms, AI credential storage, and MFA secret encryption.

## 0.0.1 - 2026-06-08

- First public preview release.
- Self-hosted Bun CMS server with SQLite and Postgres support.
- React admin UI with visual site editor, content/data/media workspaces, publishing pipeline, and plugin runtime.
- Docker image, Compose files, release bundle, and Railway/Render/VPS deployment docs.
